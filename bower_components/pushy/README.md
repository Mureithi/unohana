#Pushy

Pushy is a responsive off-canvas navigation menu using CSS transforms & transitions. This project was inspired by the off-canvas navigation menu seen on [Medium](https://medium.com/).

- Menu closes when a link is selected.
- Menu closes when the site overlay is selected.
- It's responsive!

##Requirements

- jQuery 1.9+

##Usage

1. Include jQuery.

2. Add the stylesheet (pushy.css) in your head and the JS (pushy.min.js) file in your footer.

3. Insert the following markup into your body.

```html
<!-- Pushy Menu -->
<nav class="pushy pushy-left">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Site Overlay -->
<div class="site-overlay"></div>

<!-- Your Content -->
<div id="container">
    <!-- Menu Button -->
    <div class="menu-btn">&#9776; Menu</div>
</div>
```

##Tips

- Use the ```.push``` CSS class on HTML elements outside of the ```#container```.

```html
<header class="push">
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
</header>

<!-- Your Content -->
<div id="container"></div>
```

- If you change the width of the ```.pushy``` menu, be sure to update the values in the ```.pushy-left```and ```.container-push, .push-push``` CSS classes.

```css

.pushy{
    width: 400px; /* Changed the width to 400px */
}

.pushy-left{
    transform: translate3d(-400px,0,0); /* Updated the values */
    /* Don't forget the vendor prefixes */
}

.container-push, .push-push{
    transform: translate3d(400px,0,0); /* Updated the values */
    /* Don't forget the vendor prefixes */
}
```

- If you want to prevent scrolling of your site when Pushy is open just add overflow-x: hidden and height: 100% to both the html & body tags.

```css
html, body{
    overflow-x: hidden;
    height: 100%;
}
```
