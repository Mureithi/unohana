# Unohana

## Brief
Unohana is a survey tool build on web frameworks. These include:
  + NodeJS [Backend]
    + Sequelize
    + ExpressJS
    + Node Package Manager (NPM)
  + AngularJS (1.4.\*) [Frontend]
    + Bower (Package Manager)
    + Gulp

## Database Infrastructure
For Testing purposes, we are running MYSQL (5.6.\*) with a provision to migrate to PostgreSQL (9.\*).

## Testing
Since the ecosystem is predominantly based on Javascript, we employ [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.5/introduction.html) running on [KarmaJS](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) for our end-to-end unit tests.
